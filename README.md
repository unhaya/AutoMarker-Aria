# AutoMarker Aria

**AI prepares your weapons. You do the hunting.**

## Why This Exists

When exploring unfamiliar territory, you don't know what noise to filter out.

Search "ergonomics" → Amazon chairs, Rakuten desks, job listings flood your results. You didn't know to exclude them because you're new to the field.

**Perplexity approach**: AI searches for you, gives you answers.
**Aria approach**: AI builds your search strategy, you explore and judge.

The difference matters. AI can predict noise in domains it knows. But discovery—finding unexpected connections, questioning sources, building understanding—that's human work.

This tool lets AI do what it's good at (predicting junk), so you can do what you're good at (thinking).
