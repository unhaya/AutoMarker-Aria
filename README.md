# AutoMarker Aria

**Search smarter without thinking harder.**

Let's be honest — typing `AND` keywords and `-Amazon` exclusions every time is kind of a drag.

AutoMarker Aria is a Chrome extension that lets AI handle the search tricks, so you just look at results.

- **Important terms** get color-coded automatically
- **Junk words** get filtered out for you
- **Google stays Google** — nothing changes except it's cleaner

No complicated setup. Just search, and your eyes know where to look.

This isn't an AI that gives you answers. It's one that makes searching feel less stupid.

## What It Does

1. **AI generates**: Keywords to highlight + Noise to exclude
2. **You search**: Clean results with important terms color-coded

## Install

1. Download ZIP from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Unzip
3. Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → Enable "Developer mode"
4. "Load unpacked" → Select the unzipped folder

## Setup

⚙ → Set API key (Claude / OpenAI / Gemini)

Custom prompt available in Advanced section.

## Usage

### Auto-Highlight (No Setup Required)
Just search on Google. Your search terms are automatically highlighted — on the search results page AND on pages you visit from results.

Each word gets a distinct color (yellow, pink, purple, green) so you can visually track multiple terms at once.

Toggle "Auto" in the header to enable/disable. Works with uAutoPagerize for infinite scroll pages.

### With AI
1. Enter theme
2. Click AI Build
3. Search opens with keywords highlighted

### Without AI
No API key needed. Type keywords directly into slots — highlights work on any page.

## Highlight Levels

**Default view: L1 + L2 (4 keywords)** — enough for most searches.

Click "+ More" to expand L3 + L4 for deep research.

| Level | Color | Purpose | When to use |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| L1 | Yellow | Core theme + synonym | Always |
| L2 | Pink | Evidence, data, research | Always |
| L3 | Purple | Quality signals (white paper, guide) | Deep dive |
| L4 | Green | Adjacent concepts | Comprehensive exploration |

Colors customizable. Exclusion words (-Amazon -楽天 etc.) auto-generated by AI — smart enough to never conflict with your search terms.

## Search Strategy Presets

Choose your research mode from the dropdown:

| Preset | Goal | Best for |
